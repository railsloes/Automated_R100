# Task 2 Context Analysis

**Task Goal:** Implement a tool/module within Radical100 that can read content from specified Notion pages or databases, potentially for use in project definition or task generation.

**Narrative Overview:**
Radical100 currently relies on local markdown files for project definitions and instructions. Integrating Notion could allow for more dynamic and collaborative project setup. This task involves creating a reusable component that interacts with the Notion API to fetch page/database content.

**Focus Points:**
*   Need to choose and integrate a Python Notion client library (e.g., `notion-client`).
*   Requires handling Notion API authentication (API key/integration token, likely via secrets management).
*   Define the interface for the tool: What inputs does it take (page ID, database ID, filters)? What format does it output (markdown, JSON)?
*   Consider where this tool fits in the Radical100 architecture (e.g., under `src/tools/` or `src/integrations/`).
*   Error handling for API failures, invalid IDs, or permission issues.

**Relevant Commit History (Last 3):**
*   `commit 547c324`: "Update documentation and instructions"
*   `commit cfb9555`: "Initial commit of Radical100 framework structure"
*   (No prior commits directly related to external integrations)

**Recent Errors/Logs:**
*   N/A (New feature)

**Key Variables/Data Structures:**
*   Notion Page ID / Database ID (Input)
*   Notion API Token (Configuration/Secret)
*   Page content / Database rows (Output)

**Potential Challenges:**
*   Rate limiting by the Notion API.
*   Mapping Notion's block structure to a usable format (e.g., markdown).
*   Handling different Notion content types (text, tables, databases, etc.).
*   Secure storage and retrieval of the API token.
